This website was made in attempt for a challenge, hoping to be exempted in the Finals and also a review of my knowledge for me. Some sort of like practicing XD

Notes: 
 • I am not using an online Database. I am just using a local browser storage.
 • A few link and scripts need to be loaded online, like the Font and GSAP for JS Animation. Some animations are in the CSS
 • The QR Code is not generated, it's just a picture. I didn't implemented an api to generate since I think I lack time XD
